write a program to read the file till any special characters found and print the characters till that.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>//including stdlib.h for exit()
int main()
{
	setbuf(stdout,NULL);
char ch;//declaring variable
FILE *fp=fopen("abcd.txt","r");//declaring file pointer and assigning a file to it
ch=fgetc(fp);//assigning character from file
if(fp==NULL)//checking the value of pointer
{
printf("file not found");
exit(1);//terminating from the program if an error occurs
}

do{
	if(ch != '$')//checking if the character is not *
	{
		printf("%c",ch);//printning character
	ch=fgetc(fp);//assigning character from file
	}
	else
		break;//break if $ found

}while(ch!=EOF);//iterates upto EOF
fclose(fp);//closing the file

}
