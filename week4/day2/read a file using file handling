write a program to read a file using 'r' function.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>//including stdlib.h
int main()
{
	setbuf(stdout,NULL);
char ch;//declaring variable
FILE *fp=fopen("abcd.txt","r");//declaring file pointer and assigning a file to it
ch=fgetc(fp);//assigning character from file
printf("%c",ch);//printning character
if(fp==NULL)//checking the value of pointer
{
printf("file not found");
exit(1);//terminating from the program if an error occurs
}

while(ch != EOF)//iterates upto EOF
{
	ch=fgetc(fp);//assigning character from file

	printf("%c",ch);//printning character
}
fclose(fp);//closing the file

}
