WAP to check the number is odd or even?
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
 int n;
  printf("enter the number:");
  scanf("%d",&n);
 if(n%2==0)          //arithmatic function to find even numbers
 printf("the number is even");   //if even number means prints the statement
 else
 printf("the number is odd");  //if odd means prints the statement
 

}
