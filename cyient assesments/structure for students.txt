Write a C program in structure for creating 5 student details with their name,id and age.

Algorithm:
1.start.
2.create a structure with student details like name,age and id_no.
3.use for loop for getting  the 5 student details.
4.get the data from the user and print the details in the cansole.
5.use one more for loop and print all the student details in a sequence manner.
6.stop.

code:
 
#include<stdio.h>   //header file
struct student   //create a strucute for student
{
	//create three student deatils like age,name,id_no
        int student_id;
	char student_name[10];
	int student_age;
};
int main()   //main function
{
	setbuf(stdout,NULL);   //used to clear the cache and prints the result in cansole
	struct student stud[10];   //create variable name with size for student
	int n;
	printf("enter how many student details you want ");
	scanf("%d",&n);   //get the value from use to know how many student details they want to print.
	for(int iteration=1;iteration<=n;iteration++)  //use for to get student details
	{
       //prints and gets the data from the user like student name,age and roll no.
     printf("\nenter the student id:");
	scanf("%d",&stud[iteration].student_id);
	printf("\nenter the student name:");
	fflush(stdout);
	scanf("%s",stud[iteration].student_name);
	printf("\nenter the student age:");
	fflush(stdout);
	scanf("%d",&stud[iteration].student_age);
	}
	printf("\nName\t\t ID\t\t  AGE");
	for(int iteration=1;iteration<=n;iteration++)
	{
        //prints the entire student details in a sequence mannner
	printf("\n%s\t\t %d\t\t %d",stud[iteration].student_name,stud[iteration].student_id,stud[iteration].student_age);
	}

	return 0;


}
