Write a C program to read a file and print the content in cansole.
Algorithm:
1.start
2.create a text file to read the content.
3.copy the path of text file and print it here.
4.use fopen command and 'r' command to open the file and read the file.
5.read till the end of character in the text file.
6.print the chararcters in the output cansole.
7.stop.

code: 

#include<stdio.h>  //header file for i/p operations
#include<stdlib.h>//including stdlib.h
int main()  //main function
{
      setbuf(stdout,NULL);   //clears cache and prints the output
      char ch;//declaring variable
      FILE *fp=fopen("abcd.txt","r");//declaring file pointer and assigning a file to it
      ch=fgetc(fp);       //assigning character from file
      printf("%c",ch);   //printning character
      if(fp==NULL)     //checking the value of pointer
{
printf("file not found");
exit(1);//terminating from the program if an error occurs
}

while(ch != EOF)//iterates upto EOF
{
	ch=fgetc(fp);//assigning character from file

	printf("%c",ch);//printning character
}
fclose(fp);//closing the file

}
