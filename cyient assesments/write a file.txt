Write a C program to perform file handling methods like writing the file,closing the file. 

Algorithm:
1.statrt.
2.Create a text file to open the file in the cansole window.
3.use fopen command to open the file and use 'w' command to write a any information in the cansole.
4.check the text file if the entered information is updated or not.
5.stop.

Code:

#include <stdio.h>  //header file
void main()  //main function
{
    setbuf(stdout,NULL);
    FILE *fp;   //file data type is used for file handling
    int id;   //initialize a integer variable
    char name[30];  //give char name
    float salary;   //salary in float data type
    fp = fopen("abc.txt", "w");  //fopen is used to open a file and write file handling is used here
    if (fp == NULL)   //if the file path is not correct prints the below statement.
    {
        printf("File does not exists \n");
        return;
    }
    //if the file is found perform the below operations.
    printf("Enter the id\n");
    scanf("%d", &id);   //reads the id from user
    fprintf(fp, "Id= %d\n", id);  //this function is just like printf, except that the output is written to the stream stream instead of stdout.
    printf("Enter the name \n");
    scanf("%s", name);
    fprintf(fp, "Name= %s\n", name);
    printf("Enter the salary\n");
    scanf("%f", &salary);
    fprintf(fp, "Salary= %.2f\n", salary);
    fclose(fp);//closes the file.
}
